# Pig Dice Game
#### This application constitutes of a Pig Dice game that allows two users to role a die in turn. Each player roles the die until it either falls on 1 or a consecutive sequence of numbers ranging from 2 to 6. If the die falls on one, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn. If the player decides to hold the consecutive set of numbers, it is added to their turn total and it becomes the next player's turn. The first player to score 100 or more points wins the game.  {//05/03/2019}

## User Stories
1.As a user, I want to roll the dice when it's my turn to play in the game.
2.As a user, I want to see the score I get for each roll of the dice I make in the game.
3.As a user, I want to see my cumulative score for each round I play in the game. For example, if I roll the scores 2-6-3 consecutively, I should see my end score as 11.
4.As a user, I want the option to hold my score when I'm satisfied with the points I've gained in a round of playing. The game should, therefore, add my held score to my most recent cumulative score.
5.As a user, I want to be alerted when my dice rolls on number 1. This will help me know that I can't roll the dice until the alternate player takes their round.
6.As a user, I need a way to know which player has won the game, which means they have scored 100 points before the alternate player.
